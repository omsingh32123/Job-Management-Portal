The Job Management Portal is a user-friendly web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It simplifies the job application process for both job seekers and employers. Job seekers can browse and apply for job listings, create profiles, and upload resumes, while employers can post job openings, manage applications, and track candidates. The portal offers secure user authentication and role-based access control to ensure the right permissions for different users. This project provides a seamless and efficient platform for job management and application tracking.
